# Memoria (Game Launcher)
## Description
 Memoria is a game launcher hosted locally on your computer. It has a folder named "Jeux" where all the games we want him to show are stored and when you launch it will browse inside this folder and next will show on the graphic interface all the games he found in the form of buttons allowing on click to launch directly the game. It's a project that allows me to save time on the search for certain games on my computer.
